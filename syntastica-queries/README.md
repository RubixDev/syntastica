# `syntastica-queries`

Collection of tree-sitter queries for
[`syntastica`](https://crates.io/crates/syntastica).

See
[the project overview](https://rubixdev.github.io/syntastica/syntastica/#crates-for-internal-use)
for more information.

This crate defines constants for three types of tree-sitter queries for lots of
parsers. It is intended to be used via
[`syntastica-parsers`](https://crates.io/crates/syntastica-parsers),
[`syntastica-parsers-git`](https://crates.io/crates/syntastica-parsers-git), or
[`syntastica-parsers-gitdep`](https://github.com/RubixDev/syntastica/tree/main/syntastica-parsers-gitdep).

The three types of queries are:

1. `highlights`: defining the highlight captures for nodes
2. `injections`: defining where other languages are injected for highlighting
3. `locals`: keeping track of scopes, variables, parameters, etc. to have
   occurrences of those be highlighted the same everywhere

The constants are defined as `<language_name>_<kind>[_CRATES_IO]` where `<kind>`
is one of `HIGHLIGHTS`, `INJECTIONS`, or `LOCALS`. The `INJECTIONS` and `LOCALS`
may be empty for some languages. The constants with the `_CRATES_IO` suffix aim
to be compatible with the latest version of the parser that was published on
[crates.io](https://crates.io). These are used by
[`syntastica-parsers`](https://crates.io/crates/syntastica-parsers), whereas the
normal queries are used by
[`syntastica-parsers-git`](https://crates.io/crates/syntastica-parsers-git) and
[`syntastica-parsers-gitdep`](https://github.com/RubixDev/syntastica/tree/main/syntastica-parsers-gitdep).

The crate source is automatically generated with `cargo xtask codegen` inside
the `syntastica` workspace.
