# `lua-pattern`

Parser for Lua patterns and conversion to regular expressions.

This crate provides a basic parser for Lua patterns, and, with the `to-regex`
feature enabled, conversion to standard regular expressions as usable by the
[`regex`](https://crates.io/crates/regex) or
[`fancy-regex`](https://crates.io/crates/fancy-regex) crate.
